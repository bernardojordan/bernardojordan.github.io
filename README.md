## PATHWAY-BASED APPROACH TO MODELING CAUSALITY AND DETECTING GLIOBLASTOMA 
Glioblastoma is a highly aggressive form of primary brain tumor that is not fully understood. Even with our current advancements in treatments, the survival rate of patients is very poor. Therefore, research is being done in detecting and understanding low grade glioblastoma in hopes of providing better treatment. 

### Objectives

Goal of the Capstone:
* Create a process to create biologically relevent models to classify Low-Grade Glioblastoma.
* Explore casuality between pathways using a Bayesian Network.

### Dataset

The dataset used was the REMBRANT dataset. This dataset consisted of genetic expression data for patients that had Glioblastoma and their grade.

### Methods
